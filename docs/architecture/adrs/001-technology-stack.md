# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a technology stack for the Airbnb Image Optimizer application that can handle:
- Real-time image processing
- AI-powered room detection and optimization
- Scalable web scraping
- High-performance API endpoints
- Modern user interface
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for the React framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Testing Library** and **Playwright** for testing

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless functions
- **Node.js 18** as the runtime
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Zod** for runtime validation

### External Services
- **Apify** for web scraping
- **Google Gemini** for AI image processing
- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring
- **Loki** and **Promtail** for log aggregation

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality
- **Jest** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for E2E testing
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## Rationale

### Next.js 14
- **Full-stack framework**: Combines frontend and backend in one application
- **App Router**: Modern routing with improved performance
- **Serverless**: Automatic scaling and deployment
- **TypeScript support**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for React applications

### TypeScript
- **Type safety**: Prevents runtime errors and improves code quality
- **Developer experience**: Better IDE support and autocomplete
- **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and maintain large codebases
- **Team collaboration**: Clear interfaces and contracts

### Tailwind CSS
- **Utility-first**: Rapid UI development
- **Consistency**: Design system enforcement
- **Performance**: Small bundle size with purging
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive design utilities

### Apify
- **Reliability**: Robust web scraping infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Handles complex scraping scenarios
- **Maintenance**: No need to maintain scraping infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Built-in rate limiting and respect for robots.txt

### Google Gemini
- **AI capabilities**: Advanced image analysis and generation
- **Integration**: Easy API integration
- **Performance**: Fast processing times
- **Cost**: Competitive pricing for AI services

### Vercel
- **Deployment**: Seamless deployment from Git
- **Performance**: Global CDN and edge functions
- **Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and monitoring
- **Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives
- **React with Vite**: More complex setup, less integrated
- **Vue.js**: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript support
- **Svelte**: Less mature, smaller community

### Backend Alternatives
- **Express.js**: More boilerplate, manual configuration
- **Fastify**: Less ecosystem, steeper learning curve
- **NestJS**: Over-engineering for this use case

### External Services Alternatives
- **Puppeteer**: More maintenance, infrastructure overhead
- **OpenAI**: More expensive, different API patterns
- **AWS**: More complex setup, vendor lock-in

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid development**: Full-stack framework reduces setup time
- **Type safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
- **Performance**: Next.js optimizations improve user experience
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture handles traffic spikes
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture and TypeScript improve code quality

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in**: Vercel-specific features may limit portability
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn Next.js App Router
- **Cost**: External services add operational costs
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on third-party services

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Setup
1. Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up ESLint and Prettier
4. Create basic project structure

### Phase 2: Backend Development
1. Implement API routes for optimization
2. Integrate Apify for web scraping
3. Integrate Google Gemini for AI processing
4. Add error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. Create user interface components
2. Implement job status tracking
3. Add image comparison functionality
4. Implement download features

### Phase 4: Testing and Monitoring
1. Set up unit tests with Jest
2. Implement E2E tests with Playwright
3. Configure monitoring with Prometheus
4. Set up logging with Loki

## Monitoring

We will monitor:
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput
- **Reliability**: Error rates, uptime
- **Cost**: External service usage and costs
- **Developer experience**: Build times, test coverage

## Review

This decision will be reviewed:
- **Monthly**: Performance and cost metrics
- **Quarterly**: Technology stack evaluation
- **Annually**: Complete technology review
